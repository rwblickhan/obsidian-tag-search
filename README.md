# Obsidian Tag Search

Fuzzy-find your tags!

This is a simple plugin that adds a command to fuzzy-find tags and open them in search, which is a bit more convenient than opening them either through the tag pane or the search pane.
Note that it depends on having the core search plugin enabled.

Press Cmd or Ctrl to append / toggle selections in the search pane, just like from the tag pane.
Press Shift to negate selections (appending `-tag:`) to the search pane.
These can also be combined!
