# Obsidian Tag Search

Fuzzy-find your tags!

Do you have a lot of tags? Is opening the tag pane and scanning an alphabetical list of tags an annoyance? Then this Obsidian plugin might be for you.

Note: this plugin depends on the Search core plugin.

## Usage

Use the Tag Search command from the command prompt to open a fuzzy-find modal with all of your tags. Select a tag to open it in the global search pane.

Press Cmd or Ctrl to append the selection to the current search, just like the tag pane.
Press Shift to negate the search (`-tag:`).
You can also combine Cmd/Ctrl and Shift to append a negated search.

## Install

Search for Tag Search in the Community Plugins section of settings.
Alternatively, [click here](https://obsidian-plugins.peak-dev.org/show/tag-search) to install it to your most recently used vault.
